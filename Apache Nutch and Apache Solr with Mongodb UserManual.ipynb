    "## Apache Nutch, Apache Solr, Mongo DB Installation Procedure and User Manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisite:**\n",
    "1. Some or good grip on the Linux administration commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Should have idea about installation of Operating Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Should have good idea about the VMware players (if installation is to be done on VM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Installation Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation of Operating System/Virtual Machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. The above products of Apache would run good on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS version of the operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. You can get the image files of the OS by clicking on the link:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop (Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS / Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS)\n",
    "    \n",
    "c. If the system is running on Windows Operating System, then it would be better to make a dualboot for the other operating system to be installed or we can use the VMware Workstation Player 15.xx version for the installation of the Ubuntu OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. Link for VMware: https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstationplayer/workstation-player-evaluation.html\n",
    "    \n",
    "d. Please install the VMWare Workstation Player.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. After installation and running VMWare Workstation Player, you would get the window where there is a tab called Create a New Virtual Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "f. After the click, please ensure the details are filled and the path to the installation of image file of the Linux is to be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "g. Then we could customize the processor speed, RAM, others as per the system requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "h. After clicking finish, the virtual machine would start up and the installation of OS would be in process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installation of Java Version:**\n",
    "\n",
    "i. After the running of Linux OS, use the key Ctrl+Alt+T (To Open Terminal).\n",
    "j. After the opening of the terminal, please follow the below steps:\n",
    "i. Installation of Java with related commands:\n",
    "a. sudo su (Run the programs in administrator mode)\n",
    "b. sudo apt-get update (To check for the updates of OS)\n",
    "c. sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk\n",
    "d. java -version\n",
    "e. export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64\n",
    "f. export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin\n",
    "Expected output:\n",
    "openjdk version \"1.8.0_131\"\n",
    "OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-8u131-b11-2ubuntu1.16.04.3-b11)\n",
    "OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.131-b11, mixed mode)\n",
    "Installation of Apache Nutch/Mongodb/Apache Solr: Your flavor of Linux may vary, if you have the correct versions of the main components like MongoDB, Nutch, and Solr, you should be good. I did not try setting this up on the Mac though. We will stick to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for the rest of this installation procedure. Apache Nutch Nutch 2.x is only available as a source bundle, so it will need to be built using ant after configuring. $ wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/nutch/2.3.1/apache-nutch-2.3.1-src.tar.gz $ tar xvfz apache-nutch-2.3.1-src.tar.gz $ cd apache-nutch-2.3.1/conf Next, we configure Nutch by editing $NUTCH_HOME/conf/nutch-site.xml. (Nutch home : the path of the directory) This is where we define the crawldb database driver, enable plugins, and the crawl behavior, to restrict it to only the domain defined. Figure 1.1: The configuration lines that are addressed in nutch-site.xml file. The path to the xml file : https://gist.github.com/lobster1234/ef8e9f6fbea6154da720d2534d490706#file-nutch-site-xml\n",
    "Figure 1.2: These configuration lines that are addressed above need to copy into $NUTCH_HOME/conf/nutch-site.xml and nutch-default.xml We then instruct Nutch to use MongoDB via the $NUTCH_HOME/conf/gora.properties file. Nutch 2.x uses Apache Gora to manage persistence. Figure 1.3: The configuration lines that are addressed in $NUTCH_HOME/conf/gora.properties file file. The path to the xml file : https://gist.github.com/lobster1234/60a4422b398c029dca0e3ee452c5dd2a#file-gora-properties\n",
    "We also change $NUTCH_HOME/conf/ivy/ivy.xml to enable MongoDB driver which will be used by Apache Gora. This is done by uncommenting the MongoDB line in the file. <!-- Uncomment this to use MongoDB as Gora backend. --> <dependency org=\"org.apache.gora\" name=\"gora-mongodb\" rev=\"0.6.1\" conf=\"*->default\" /> Figure 1.4: The configuration lines that needs to be uncommented via the $NUTCH_HOME/conf/ivy/ivy.xml file. The path to the xml file : https://gist.github.com/lobster1234/7edffdff1410102013b3d271f6e22c35\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "a. Please change the url path in the $NUTCH_HOME/conf/ivy/ivysettings.xml file.\n",
    "b. Change the http to https in the first four lines of the code as show in the figure below:\n",
    "Figure 1.5: We need to change the http to https in file $NUTCH_HOME/ivy/ivysettings.xml. Now we build Nutch. Install ant if it is not installed already. $ sudo apt-get install ant And we build Nutch from $NUTCH_HOME folder. $ pwd /home/ubuntu/apache-nutch-2.3.1 $ ant runtime This would take about 9-12 mins to get the build ready.\n",
    "MongoDB\n",
    "The installation procedure for mongodb in Ubuntu. $ wget https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1604-3.4.7.tgz $ mkdir data $ mkdir logs $ tar xvfz mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1604-3.4.7.tgz $ cd mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1604-3.4.7/bin $ ./mongod --dbpath ~/data/ --logpath ~/logs/mongodb.log –-fork (Make sure that the data and logs mentioned here is the path of the directory in which the extracted data is available. EX: /home/abhay/Desktop/Nutch/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ununtu1604-3.4.7/data/ or /logs)\n",
    "Solr Let us get Solr 6.5.1 set up. We will download and install Solr, and create a core named nutch to index the crawled pages. Then, we will copy the schema.xml from Nutch configuration to this newly created core. $ wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/6.5.1/solr-6.5.1.tgz $ tar xvfz solr-6.5.1.tgz $ cd solr-6.5.1/bin $ ./solr start $ ./solr create_core -c nutch -d basic_configs $ ./solr stop $ cd ../server/solr/nutch/conf $ cp ~/apache-nutch-2.3.1/conf/schema.xml . Here comes the skullduggery. We will need to “fix” schema.xml and solrconfig.xml in this folder. We will also remove the managed-schema file, as we’re providing the schema configuration externally. $ rm managed-schema $ vi schema.xml Please find the changed file in the given link and change accordingly: https://gist.github.com/lobster1234/35078e4fc1df30e249b986e19fd67202\n",
    "It is important to remove all instances of enablePositionIncrements=\"true\" from every <filter class=\"solr.StopFilterFactory\" declaration. If not removed, the core will fail to initialize. Next, we have to fix the solrconfig.xml $ vi solrconfig.xml Locate the section for AddSchemaFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory and comment out the <lst> elements, like so- <processor class=\"solr.AddSchemaFieldsUpdateProcessorFactory\"> <str name=\"defaultFieldType\">strings</str> <!-- <lst name=\"typeMapping\"> <str name=\"valueClass\">java.lang.Boolean</str> <str name=\"fieldType\">booleans</str> </lst> <lst name=\"typeMapping\"> <str name=\"valueClass\">java.util.Date</str> <str name=\"fieldType\">tdates</str> </lst> <lst name=\"typeMapping\"> <str name=\"valueClass\">java.lang.Long</str> <str name=\"valueClass\">java.lang.Integer</str> <str name=\"fieldType\">tlongs</str> </lst> <lst name=\"typeMapping\"> <str name=\"valueClass\">java.lang.Number</str> <str name=\"fieldType\">tdoubles</str> </lst> --> </processor> Now, we start solr.\n",
    "Crawl and Index Now that we have everything set up, we are ready to put Nutch in action. First, tell nutch what URL(s) to crawl. We do this by creating a simple text file and pointing Nutch to it. $ cd ~/apache-nutch-2.3.1/ $ mkdir urls $ vi urls/seeds.text Enter the URL(s) in this file, for example. https://www.wikipedia.org. One URL per line. Once the seed file is set up, run the following - $ runtime/local/bin/nutch inject urls/ InjectorJob: starting at 2020-02-13 07:43:22 InjectorJob: Injecting urlDir: urls InjectorJob: Using class org. apache. gora.mongodb.store.MongoStore as the Gora storage class. InjectorJob: total number of urls rejected by filters: 0 InjectorJob: total number of urls injected after normalization and filtering: 1 Injector: finished at 2020-02-13 07:43:25, elapsed: 00:00:03 This has initialized the crawl database - we can use the MongoDB CLI to check out the resulting database and collection. Path : $NUTCH_HOME/ mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1604-3.4.7/bin/./mongo > show dbs local 0.000GB nutchdb 0.005GB > use nutchdb switched to db nutchdb > show collections webpage\n",
    "Next, we generate the top 50 URLs. Do not worry if you see a different number like 20 below. $ runtime/local/bin/nutch generate -topN 50 $ runtime/local/bin/crawl urls <namedb> <solrurl> <number of rounds> GeneratorJob: starting at 2020-02-13 08:56:36 GeneratorJob: Selecting best-scoring urls due for fetch. GeneratorJob: starting GeneratorJob: filtering: true GeneratorJob: normalizing: true GeneratorJob: topN: 50 GeneratorJob: finished at 2020-02-13 08:56:38, time elapsed: 00:00:02 GeneratorJob: generated batch id: 1502528196-1091715892 containing 20 URLs Now that Nutch has selected N URLs, we go ahead fetch them. $ runtime/local/bin/nutch fetch -all This will fetch the N URLs, and we’ll see a ton of output. Once fetched, the content needs to be parsed. $ runtime/local/bin/nutch parse -all Next, we update the DB with the current status. $ runtime/local/bin/nutch updatedb -all\n",
    "Finally, we index these pages in Solr $ runtime/local/bin/nutch solrindex http://localhost:8983/solr/nutch -all IndexingJob: starting Active IndexWriters : SOLRIndexWriter solr.server.url : URL of the SOLR instance (mandatory) solr.commit.size : buffer size when sending to SOLR (default 1000) solr.mapping.file : name of the mapping file for fields (default solrindex-mapping.xml) solr.auth : use authentication (default false) solr.auth.username : username for authentication solr.auth.password : password for authentication If you have access to the Solr console (http://localhost:8983), fire it up in a browser. Here, we’re querying Solr for any content that matches test (hence q=content:test) and only return the url, meta_description, and anchor (hence fl=url,%20meta_description,%20anchor,%20title). We will get a list of at most 10 results in a JSON format. You may want to play with different values for different fields either via the Solr Console or curl. Refer to Solr query syntax here.
